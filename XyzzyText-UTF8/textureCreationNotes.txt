Instructions on how to generate the texture are already published on Xyzzy main page, but just to be sure I repeat them here:

    openup photoshop
    click the vbs script in explorer and it will run over your photoshop
    add one temporary layer and fill it with black just to see your characters
    select one text layer and use "select similar layers"
    change your font, size etc from the text tool and look how they appear (NOTE: should be monospace font)
    merge all the selected layer into one single one
    go to channel tab in layers, and add one new (alpha channel) it will be black per default
    go to your font normal layer and select all
    go to your alpha channel and paste it down
    be sure to have the temporary black layer deselected and to select RGB layers so to see transparency in red
    save as tga 32 bit and upload it to SL.
